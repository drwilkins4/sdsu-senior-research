Authors: David Wilkins, Luke Glass, Dr. Fridolin Weber

Written September 2021 - May 2022

Description: Uses properties of subatomic particles to compute the equation of state for quark matter based on the MIT Bag Model. Then uses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation to compute the stellar model sequence of quark stars according to the equation of state.
